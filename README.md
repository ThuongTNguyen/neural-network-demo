A demo for neural network models to represent water dimer potential energy surface. 
=========================
This contains an example code to demonstrate the procedure to build neural network models for [the paper](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024577) in The Journal of Chemical Physics by Thuong Nguyen et. al. 

Note that the public code here is not in the final optimal version used either for software development or for publication. It also has shorter training iterations than the actual version.
